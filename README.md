# Unlocking Transcriptomic Insights: Streamlining RNA-seq Analysis from Raw Data to Athena Queries with Quilt Packages

## Objective

In this tutorial series, we demonstrate the benefit of packaging raw -omics data with 

Maximize the utility of your data. 

## Tutorials

We have generated a series of 4 core tutorials (+ 1 optional). For the purpose of this tutorial, we are using a subset of publicly available RNA-sequencing data generated by the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) initiative. However, this tutorial is generalizable -- with the core principles applying across data types, and reproducible with your in-house datasets.
