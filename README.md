# Unlocking NGS Insights: From Raw Data to Athena Queries with Quilt Packages and Metadata

In this tutorial series, we demonstrate the benefit of packaging raw -omics data with .

The ultimate goal of this demo is to provide a framework capable of maximizing the utility of your data.

## Tutorials

We have generated a series of 4 core tutorials (+ 1 optional) demonstrating framework to XXX

The tutorials are in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, and are fully executable. To run the notebooks, the following pre-requisites are required:

1. Python >=3.7
2. AWS credentials
3. Quilt Open Data Account
4. NextFlow Tower Account (optional)
5. 

For the purpose of this tutorial, we are using a subset of publicly available RNA-sequencing data generated by the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) initiative. However, this tutorial is generalizable -- with the core principles applying across data types, and reproducible with your in-house datasets.
